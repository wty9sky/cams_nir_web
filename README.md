## Welcome to CAMS-NIR

We devote our primary research efforts to building real-world applications using information technologies and AI in the tele-nursing domain to enhance patient outcomes.

## CAMS-NIR Portfolio

The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Nursing Informatics Research Laboratory (CAMS-NIR) stands at the forefront of integrating nursing science with advanced information technology to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Our commitment is to leverage the potential of tele-health technologies, facilitating continuous and comprehensive care as patients transition from hospital to home.


At CAMS-NIR , we prioritize the usability of wearable devices for vital signs monitoring and utilize digital platforms for collecting patients' feedback on symptoms and well-being. Our expertise in data analytics and machine learning drives the development of predictive models that personalize care plans and minimize the risk of hospital readmissions. By analyzing diverse data sources, including electronic health records, patient-reported outcomes, and real-time monitoring data, we aim to extract insights that enable more effective and timely nursing interventions. Additionally, we are dedicated to developing chatbot systems aimed at fostering healthy lifestyle habits among patients with chronic diseases.

At CAMS-NIR , we integrate SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms) into our telenursing standards documentation to enhance the precision, interoperability, and effectiveness of tele-nursing services. Collaborating closely with leading research labs, CAMS-NIR contributes to the creation of healthcare knowledge graphs, supporting research communities with valuable insights.
